# demo-bash-awk
Demonstration repository of an introductory bash and awk exercise, to which I wrote solutions. The source of the exercise is mentioned and linked to in my markdown file in this repository.

Regarding copy rights, etc., during the time of the course this exercise stems from, all course related and student files were public. So I do not feel bad putting some of them here for demonstration or similar purposes. If you refer your interested friends / colleagues to me directly, I can give them access, too, and will be happy to offer additional advice.

Should you be interested in solving the exercises by yourself, you can find the original (with some comments of mine) course files of that day in the folder `files related to this exercise`. In that case, be sure to check out the folder `cheatsheets I found useful`, too.

If you have access to this file and are sort of lazy (read stuff above to get more out of this repo.), just be sure you keep the author mention of me in there if you copy it or whatever. Asking me for my current email address for sharing would be nice, too. That's all.
