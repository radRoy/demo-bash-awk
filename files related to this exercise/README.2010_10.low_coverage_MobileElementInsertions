Mobile Element Insertion VCF files   28 June 2010  Chip Stewart

Mobile Element Insertions (MEI) were detected using two algorithms. The read pair 
(RP)  algorithm was based on clusters of SLX read pairs in which the fragments span 
into the insertion from both sides. The split read algorithm (SR) was based on the 
local alignment of 454 reads that cross over the insertion breakpoints.   Detection 
was performed by both algorithms on pilot 1 and pilot 2 data independently.  The VCF 
files for pilot 1 (low_coverage) and pilot 2 (trios) are formed from the merged set 
of events from both algorithms. Algorithm merging combined events within +/-100bp of 
the boundary of the event confidence intervals.    

There are 3 vcf files subdivided by population:

Required VCF fields

CHROM
chromosome for insertion event

POS
NCBI build 36.3 position of insertion

ID
Unique identifer

REF
Reference nucleotide at POS

ALT 
<INS:ME:ALU> is used for Alu element insertions. 
<INS:ME:L1> is used for L1 element insertions. 
<INS:ME:SVA> is used for SVA element insertions. 

QUAL
The phred quality value for insertions is calculated from the number of  fragments 
supporting the alternate (ME insertion) allele. The probablity that the call is not 
an insertion is estimated from poisson probability that 1 mismapped fragment could 
fluctuate to the observed number of ALT supporting fragments or more.  The Q value is
boosted by 10 for events detected by both SR and RP algorithms and events captured 
at both ends by 454 spanning fragments are also boosted by 10. The maximum Q value is
40.  

FILTER
Filter flags indicate that the given event was experimentally tested by PCR and  
invalidated (PCR_invalidated), or the event is in close proximity (+/-200bp) to a 
7SLRNA annotation element (UCSC repeat masker 3.27). These 7SLRNA elements are 
Alu-like sequences that are strongly associated with false detected Alu insertions.  

INFO fields:

SVTYPE
'INS' for insertion.

SVLEN
Estimated length of the inserted sequence. This includes both the element and one 
copy of the TSD.  The length of the element is estimated from the mapped coordinate 
positions within the element reference sequence.  This is an indirect measurement of 
the insertion size which is dependent on mapping both ends of the right element 

sub-class (eg. AluyA5 or L1HS). Mapping difficulties associated with long poly-A 
tails will also lead to shortened SVLEN estimates. Some 454 calls do not capture both
breakpoints bracketing the inserted sequence, so these calls have a limited power to 
estimate the insertion length. For these calls SVLEN is omitted. 

SVMETHOD0
RP (read pair algorithm) or SR (split read). SR|RP indicates that both algorithms 
detected the given insertion. 

CIPOS
The 98% confidence interval of the insertion position relative to POS. The scale of 
the CI's is based on observed residuals with known dbRIP MEI insertion.  The RP 
algorithm CI's are also dependent on the density of fragments bracketing the 
insertion breakpoints.  


VALIDATED, VALMETHOD
Flag indicating that the given loci was validated by PCR experiments done at LSU, 
EMBL, or Yale. 

DBRIPID
The DBRIP ID for events within 200bp of a DBRIP entry 
(http://dbrip.brocku.ca/dbRIPdownload/ circa 8 June 2010). 

PUBID
Previously published Mobile element insertions within 200bp that were either not 
listed in DBRIP of partially listed in DBRIP are identified with a PUBID: 
* Mills|GR2008 is from Mills et. al. Genome Res. 2006 16(9) 1182-90. 
* Xing|GR2009 is from Xing et. al. Genome Res. 2009 19(9):1516-2.
* Kidd|Nature2008 is from Xing et. al. Nature. 2008 453(7191):56-64. 
* Ewing|GR2010 is from Ewing and Kazazian, Genome Res. 2010 Jun 8 (epub). 
The Xing et.al insertions are listed in dbRIP but the original published list was 
used here.

NOVEL
Any event not matched to a DBRIP or PUBID entry is tagged as 'Novel'. 

HOMLEN
The estimated length of the Tandem Site Duplication (TSD) homology on both sides of 
the insertion. 

NSF5
The count of ALT supporting fragments spanning into the insertions from the 5' side. 

NSF3
The count of ALT supporting fragments spanning into the insertions from the 3' side.
